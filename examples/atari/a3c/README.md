# A3C
This example trains an Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C) agent, from the following paper: [Asynchronous Methods for Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01783). 

## Requirements

- atari_py>=0.1.1
- opencv-python

## Running the Example

```
python train_a3c.py [options]
```

### Useful Options
- `--gpu`. Specifies the GPU. If you do not have a GPU on your machine, run the example with the option `--gpu -1`. E.g. `python train_dqn.py --gpu -1`.
- `--env`. Specifies the environment. 
- `--render`. Add this option to render the states in a GUI window.
- `--seed`. This option specifies the random seed used.
- `--outdir` This option specifies the output directory to which the results are written.

To view the full list of options, either view the code or run the example with the `--help` option.

## Results
These results reflect ChainerRL  `v0.6.0`. The ChainerRL score currently consists of a single run. The reported results are compared against the scores from the [Noisy Networks Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.10295.pdf)

We aim to follow the original paper's evaluation protocol as closely as possible.
